# this file is going to evaluate the model once it has been trained
# by comparing the drugs generated for a given protein and drug against the actual drugs
# that have been shown to be effective for that protein

# once we incorporate the targeted effect prediction as well, we will also compare the predicted
# effects of the drugs against the actual effects of the drugs
