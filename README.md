# Gernstein Lab Work

This repository contains all of the code related to molecular manipulation and pocket prediction for the work that I am doing with the Gernstein Lab at Yale University. An explanation of the subfolders and projects is found below:

| **Pocket Prediction** | This project, Gernstein Lab Pocket Prediction, is a collaboration with Alan Ianeselli at Yale University. It focuses on using machine learning to predict binding pockets in proteins, aiming to reduce the time required for pocket identification and potentially aiding in drug discovery. More details can be found by contacting [Tristan Brigham](mailto:tristan.brigham@yale.edu) or [Alan Ianeselli](mailto:alan.ianeselli@yale.edu). |
